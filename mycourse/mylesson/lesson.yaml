- Class: text
  Output: "Welcome to the swirl lesson on text cleaning with regular expression! 
  This lesson is going to give you some basic tools for regular expression. 
  And with the basic tools, we will dive into the real world example of text mining using tweets."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by looking at an example text extracted from Seinfeld script. Please type twix in your console.
  CorrectAnswer: "twix"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='twix')
  Hint: type twix

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "It looks messy, isn't it? We want to make this single character string into a list of character string by each line of the script. 
  strsplit() command will do the job for us. 
  Let's divide our example text (twix) by two empty lines."
  CorrectAnswer: strsplit(twix, "\n\n")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='strsplit(twix, "\n\n")')
  Hint: try typing strsplit(twix, "\n\n")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now it looks much better. For more practice, 
  let's save the unlisted version of these character strings, and call it better."
  CorrectAnswer: better = unlist(strsplit(twix, "\n\n"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='better = unlist(strsplit(twix, "\n\n"))')
  Hint: try typing better = unlist(strsplit(twix, "\n\n"))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Did you notice that the character name GEORGE is misspelled at several lines.
  Luckily, they all start with G and ends with colon. 
  Let's fix the misspelled ones to GEORGE by using gsub() command, 
  and save the updated one as evenbetter."
  CorrectAnswer: evenbetter = gsub("G.*:", "GEORGE:", better)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='evenbetter = gsub("G.*:", "GEORGE:", better)')
  Hint: try typing evenbetter = gsub("G.*:", "GEORGE:", better)
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, why don't we remove all the quotation marks except for the dollar sign and colon? 
  again, using gsub() command, and save it as muchbetter. 
  You will need to use perl=TRUE option in your command"
  CorrectAnswer: muchbetter = gsub("[^c($:)[:^punct:]]", "", evenbetter, perl=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='muchbetter = gsub("[^c($:)[:^punct:]]", "", evenbetter, perl=TRUE)')
  Hint: try typing muchbetter = gsub("[^c($:)[:^punct:]]", "", evenbetter, perl=TRUE)
